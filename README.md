# BudgetBuddy
This is an interactive website that helps you track your spending and set goals for yourself, rewarding you each time your goal is met!
It was developed at Pearl Hacks 2015 with two students who were attending their first hackathon and it uses JQuery, Javascript and the Google Places API.
